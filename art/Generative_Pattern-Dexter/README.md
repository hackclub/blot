Hi everyone! This is a program I created for the Hack Club Bot that is designed to change depending on the aspect ratio of the art piece! At 1:1, the pattern is regular. However, at any other ratio the pattern changes. At a 1:1 ratio, the central pattern is designed to represent similar shapes found in architecture (and be partially similar to the look of petals on a flower, but I can understand if most people cant see it). I hope everyone enjoys this as it took a lot of figuring out the different positions!
