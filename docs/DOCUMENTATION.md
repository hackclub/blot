## Importing the blotToolkit

The functions below are available in the `blotToolkit` object.

```js
// like so
blotToolkit.scale(...)
```

`blotToolkit` is also available as the abbreviated `bt`. This is **the recommended way to reference the blotToolkit**.

```js
// like so
bt.scale(...)
```

You can also destructure the functions from `blotToolkit`.

```js
// all imports
const { Turtle, trim, merge, cut, cover, rotate, scale, translate, originate, iteratePoints, pointInside, resample, join, copy, union, difference, intersection, xor, getAngle, getPoint, getNormal, bounds, nurbs, catmullRom, rand, setRandSeed, randInRange, randIntInRange, noise } = blotToolkit;

## Modify Polylines

These functions modify a polyline that is passed as a first argument.

### iteratePoints(polylines, callback)

**Parameters:**
  - `polylines` ([number, number][][]): An array of polylines to iterate over.
  - `callback` (Function): A function that is called for each point with parameters:
    - `pt` ([number, number]): The current point.
    - `t` (number): The normalized position of the point in the polyline.

**Returns:** 
The original array of polylines with the points modified by the callback function. 
Points are mutated in place.

**Description:**

This function iterates over each point in a set of polylines. 
The provided callback function can modify each point by returning a new point, 
split the polyline by returning `"BREAK"`, 
or remove a point by returning `"REMOVE"`. 
The callback receives the current point and its normalized position within the polyline. 
Modifications are applied after all points are iterated through.

**Example:**

```js
const polylines = [[[0, 0], [10, 10], [20, 20]]];
const modifiedPolylines = bt.iteratePoints(polylines, (pt, t) => {
  const [x, y] = pt;
  // Move each point up by 5mm
  return [x, y + 5];
});

// or 

const modifiedPolylines2 = bt.iteratePoints(polylines, (pt, t) => {
  const [x, y] = pt;

  if (t < .2) {
    return "REMOVE";
  } else if (.5 > rand()) {
    return "BREAK";

  // Move each point up by 5mm
  return [x, y + 5];
});
```

  - `scale` (number | [number, number]): The scale factor to apply. If a single number is provided, the scale is uniform across both axes. If an array is provided, it specifies separate scale factors for the x (`scaleX`) and y (`scaleY`) dimensions.
  - `origin` ([number, number], optional): The point around which the scaling is performed. Defaults to bounding box center if not specified.

**Returns:** A new array of polylines that have been scaled according to the specified parameters.

**Description:**

Scales the provided polylines by a specified factor, 
optionally around a custom origin point. 
This can uniformly or non-uniformly transform the size of the polylines.
It supports both uniform scaling (where the shape's proportions are maintained) and non-uniform scaling (where the shape's proportions can change). 
The function allows for scaling around a specific origin point. 
The default origin is the center of the bounding box of the shape.

**Example:**

```js
const polylines = [
  [[0, 0], [10, 0], [10, 10], [0, 10], [0, 0]]
];

// Scale uniformly by a factor of 2
const uniformlyScaled = bt.scale(polylines, 2);

// Scale non-uniformly (x by 2, y by 3)

## Curves

### catmullRom(points, steps = 1000)

**Parameters:**
- `points` ([number, number][]): An array of points through which the curve should pass.
- `steps` (number, optional): The number of steps to divide the curve into. Defaults to 1000.

**Returns:** A polyline ([number, number][]) that represents the Catmull-Rom spline through the given points.

**Description:** 

Generates a [Catmull-Rom spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_Catmull%E2%80%93Rom_spline), which is a type of interpolating curve, passing through a series of control points. The `steps` parameter controls the smoothness of the curve, with higher values resulting in a more detailed curve.

**Example:**

```js
bt.catmullRom([[0, 0], [10, 15], [20, 5]], 100); // Returns a polyline with 100 points forming a smooth curve through the specified points
```

### nurbs(points, ops = { steps: 100, degree: 2})

**Parameters:**
- `points` ([number, number][]): An array of control points for the NURBS curve.
- `ops` (object, optional): Configuration options for the NURBS curve.
  - `steps` (number): The number of steps to divide the curve into. Defaults to 100.
  - `degree` (number): The degree of the NURBS curve. Defaults to 2.

**Returns:** A polyline ([number, number][]) that represents the NURBS curve through the given points.

**Description:** 

Generates a [Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline) curve, which provides great flexibility and precision in modeling curves. The `steps` parameter controls the smoothness of the curve, and the `degree` parameter defines the curve's degree, affecting its complexity and how tightly it fits to the control points.

**Example:**

```js
bt.nurbs([[0, 0], [10, 15], [20, 5]], { steps: 50, degree: 3 }); // Returns a polyline forming a NURBS curve with specified degree and steps
```

<!--
### svgToPolylines(svg: string)

**Parameters:**
- `svg` (string): An SVG path string to be converted into polylines.

**Returns:** An array of polylines ([number, number][][]), where each polyline corresponds to a path in the SVG.

**Description:** 

Converts SVG path data into an array of polylines. 

**Example:**

```js
bt.svgToPolylines(`<svg><path d="M0,0 L10,10 Q15,15 20,5" /></svg>`); // Returns an array of polylines representing the SVG path
```
-->

## Randomness

### rand()

**Returns:** A random number between 0 and 1.

**Description:** 

Generates a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (inclusive). This function does not require any parameters and provides a quick way to introduce randomness into your drawing or modifications.

**Example:**

```js
bt.rand(); // Might return 0.123456789
```

### randInRange(min, max)

**Parameters:**
- `min` (number): The minimum value (inclusive).
- `max` (number): The maximum value (inclusive).

**Returns:** A random number between `min` and `max`.

**Description:** 

Generates a random floating-point number within a specified range. The function takes two parameters: the minimum value (inclusive) and the maximum value (inclusive), and returns a random number within this range.

**Example:**

```js
bt.randInRange(10, 20); // Might return 15.6789
```

### randIntInRange(min, max)

**Parameters:**
- `min` (number): The minimum value (inclusive).
- `max` (number): The maximum value (inclusive).

**Returns:** A random integer between `min` and `max`.

**Description:** 

Generates a random integer within a specified range. This function is similar to `randInRange` but ensures the returned value is an integer. The `max` value is inclusive, making the range of possible outcomes slightly wider.

**Example:**

```js
bt.randIntInRange(1, 10); // Might return 7
```

### setRandSeed(seed)

**Parameters:**
- `seed` (number): A seed value to initialize the random number generator.

**Returns:** Nothing.

**Description:** 

Initializes the random number generator with a specific seed. This function is useful for creating repeatable sequences of random numbers. Setting the same seed value will reset the random number generator to produce the same sequence of numbers.

**Example:**

```js
bt.setRandSeed(12345);
```

### noise(input, options = { octaves, falloff })

**Parameters:**
- `input` (number | [number, ?number, ?number]): A single number or an array representing the coordinates (x, [y], [z]) in n-dimensional noise space.
- `options` (object, optional): Configuration options for noise generation
  - `octaves` (number [0 to 8]): The number of octaves of noise to generate. More octaves produce more detailed noise at the cost of performance.
  - `falloff` (number [0 to 100]): The rate at which the noise detail decreases across octaves.

**Returns:** A noise value between -1 and 1 based on the input coordinates and options.

**Description:** 

Generates Perlin noise or simplex noise based on the input coordinates and configuration options. This function can produce noise in one, two, or three dimensions and is configured by the number of octaves and the falloff rate. It's useful for generating natural-looking textures, landscapes, or other organic variations.

**Example:**

```js
bt.noise(0.5);
bt.noise([0.5, 2.4]);
bt.noise([0.5, 2.4, 3]);
bt.noise(0.5, { octaves: 4, falloff: 50 }); // Might return 0.3425
bt.noise([0.5, 1.2], { octaves: 3, falloff: 75 }); // Might return -0.5687
```

## Easing Curves

### bezierEasing(startY, controlPt0, controlPt1, endY)

**Parameters:**
- `startY` (number): The starting Y value of the Bezier curve.
- `controlPt0` ([number, number]): The first control point as a 2D coordinate `[x, y]`, influencing the curve's shape.
- `controlPt1` ([number, number]): The second control point as a 2D coordinate `[x, y]`, influencing the curve's shape.
- `endY` (number): The ending Y value of the Bezier curve.

**Returns:** A function that, when given an X value between 0 and 1, returns the corresponding Y value on the Bezier curve defined by the input parameters.

**Description:** 

Creates a Bezier easing function based on the provided start and end Y values and two control points. 
This function is useful for generating smooth, customizable easing curves for interpolations between two values. 
The returned function maps an input X (ranging from 0 to 1) to a Y value on the Bezier curve.

**Example:**

```js
const ease = bt.bezierEasing(0, [0.25, 0.1], [0.25, 1], 1);
const y = ease(0.5); // Returns the Y value at X=0.5 on the Bezier curve
```
