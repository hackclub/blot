# Getting a Blot

Blot is a "you ship, we ship" project. That means we will send the machine to people you build projects with the machine. And the way to start this engagement is just by getting started building.

A well designed "you ship, we ship" should feel like everyone is contributing to a coherent project while not having contributors be dependent on each other. Each contribution is self-contained and satisfying to develop on its own but the aggregate results in something greater than the sum of its parts.

With Sprig we didn't just build a DIY Gameboy, we built a whole library of games. A new class of console where everyone that plays it helped build it.

With Haxidraw we know what we are going to ship you, but we don't know what you will ship us or what we are building together.

Let's explore some ideas to address this.

## A MOMA Exhibit

Let's create a collectively developed physical/digital art exhibit for the Museum of Modern Art in NYC.

Hack Club will produce a microworld web-based environment for creating generative line drawings which can be fabricated on the Blot. We will encourage students to create a collection of digital art which can be submitted to our virtual or AR gallery space where they can see their work alongside pieces created by thousands of teens around the world. When they have curated their own exhibit (collection) in this virtual gallery we send them a machine so they can run a physical pop-up exhibit in their high school, printed using the haxidraw machines that they have assembled. We will do this for one year.

After that year, we will host a physical installation of these pop-up exhibits at a museum we partner with and fly out many contributors from around the world to celebrate their collective creation together.

There are a couple units of interaction with this model.

- an art piece
- a collection
  - a parametric art generator
- a drawing machine
- a pop-up exhibit
- the grand museum piece

## Art Piece

Design a digital art piece. You can draw it or generate it algorithmically.

Explore all the art in Hack Clubs virtual museum of plotter art.

## Collection

Make several pieces which are thematically connected.

This could be done manually or with a program which parametrically generates art.

Submit this collection to our virtual museum to receive a Blot kit.

## Drawing Machine

Assemble your machine.

## Pop-Up Exhibit

Use your machine to fabricate the art you designed.

![PXL_20230526_183529562](https://github.com/hackclub/haxidraw/assets/27078897/a6b6eaf3-bf6a-4d80-a48e-01c427c5e47f)

Host an exhibit in a local venue like your school or a makerspace.

## The Museum

Come celebrate with the community as we turn our virtual museum into a real one and share it with the world.
