# How to Get a Blot!

So you just found out about this cool robotic drawing machine which you can build yourself, but how can you get one? The Blot is paid for by Hack Club, including shipping, but you should check for customs fees in your country before ordering 

(Customs fees aren't covered by Hack Club, so please look into how much customs is for an electronics kit order being shipped from the US if you are based outside the US)

**Prefer a video instead? You can find that __[here!](https://youtu.be/AmbjNEPuv14)__**

## 1) Make a unique piece of generative art

The first step is to make some generative art like that seen in [the gallery](https://blot.hackclub.com/gallery). You can follow [these guides](https://blot.hackclub.com/guides) to learn how to do that!

Make sure your artwork meets the [submission criteria](https://blot.hackclub.com/submitting)

Once you think your artwork is done...

## 2) Make a PR with your original artwork

Once you have made some art you can make a pull request (PR) onto this repo with that program.
These are the steps you need to take to make a PR.

### 2.0) Add metadata to your `index.js` file

Make sure to include this info in a comment at the top of your file.

```js
/*
@title: yourTitle
@author: yourName
@snapshot: the name of the snapshot file you want in the gallery
*/
```

__NOTE__
- Make sure your snapshot matches the name of an image in the `snapshots` folder you submit with `.png` like `example1.png`

### 2.1) Download your program

- Hover over `download`
- Click `js`

## 2.2) Place your program in a folder with at least 3 snapshots

- Create a folder called `{yourArtworkName}-{yourName}`.
- Inside that folder create a `snapshots` folder with **at least 3 screenshots** of your work.
- Place the code for your artwork in an `index.js` file.

__NOTE__
- DO NOT USE SPACES in any folder name or file.
- Make sure you `snapshots` folder is lowercase `snapshots` not `Snapshots`

**Make sure there are no spaces in your directory or file names!**

The directory structure can be seen below:

Your PR will be reviewed by people in the BLOT community. We aren't evaluating it based on style,
we're looking to see if you put effort and creativity into your work.
Don't worry if this is the first program you have ever written, if you worked hard (at least ~8 hrs) and are proud of the result then it's probably good.
If you are an experienced programmer, then we challenge you to show us how nice generative art can be.

### 2.6) Give us a star on GitHub if you like the project (optional)
