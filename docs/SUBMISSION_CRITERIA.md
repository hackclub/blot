# Submission Criteria

## What to include:

*While there are no specific criteria we look for, we generally want a strong mix of the following:*


### Visual Engagement
Aleks' Fragmented Horizon is a great example of a detailed, intentionally drawn scene made with Blot. Pieces such as these are great examples of creative intent

### Technical Complexity
Art pieces that push the technical limits of Blot are usually interesting, engaging projects, and so we generally encourage you to do so if you are considering it! For example, Patricio's wireframe renderer can take any set of 3D coordinates and draw it on Blot. Isn't that amazing?

### Polish & Aesthetics
The art piece should be aesthetically pleasing & feel like a polished piece of work. For example, this mushroom piece by Xinyang, though it may appear simple at first, is well-put together appears polished

Your submission should be a combination of the above in varying degrees.

## What not to include:

### Linearly generated patterns

These patterns generally do not require much creative thought and are easy to generate!

### Stolen art with a few variables changed
Make your own art!

## Some final notes

- **Your artwork must be generative.** You should have some variables at the top that are controlled by randomness functions such as `bt.randIntInRange()` that change the artwork

- **Your artwork should be drawable by Blot**, which means it shouldn't excessively cross a certain area multiple times. The general guideline is that crossing over one point any more than 5 times will rip the paper.

- **Your artwork should not rely on the fill option.** (This includes color or filling with black) Unfortunately, Blot doesn't understand the fill option yet. Maybe you can be the first to add it! In the mean time, you can use thin stripes to effectively shade an area.

## Submitting
If you feel like your art piece meets these requirements, you can find the submission instructions **[here.](https://github.com/hackclub/blot/blob/main/docs/GET_A_BLOT.md)** 
Most artwork takes around 15-20 hours of work to get accepted, so make sure you really polish it before submitting.
