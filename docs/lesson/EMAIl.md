Hi,

At [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/), we build tools to help students worldwide practice coding and engineering skills by creating inspiring projects. This past year, we developed a drawing robot called [Blot](https://blot.hackclub.com), which we’ll send to any high schooler for free when they code an art piece in our web-based programming environment.

We believe the best way to cap off a year of learning AP CS material is with a project that lets students apply their knowledge to create tangible results.

Blot is part of our “You Ship, We Ship” program. When students create projects with our tools and share them publicly, we send them physical engineering kits. Blot was developed with support from MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms and is funded by donors like Tom Preston-Werner, the founder of GitHub.

You can find an example lesson plan for using Blot in your classroom here: [hack.af/learnblot](https://hack.af/learnblot).

Through drawing projects students can practice logic branching, function calls, one and two-dimensional arrays, and recursive algorithms.

Additionally, we offer another project called [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com), where students can program tile based games in JavaScript. When they share their games with us, we send them the materials to build a handheld console to play those games.

If you’d like posters for Blot and Sprig for your classroom, you can [sign up to receive them here](https://airtable.com/appv0BzBY2APyIXj6/shrk2RTYPbpM1KlKF). We’d also love your feedback on how these tools can fit into your curriculum.

Best regards,

Zach
Founder of Hack Club

P.S. I’ve cc'd Leo, the creator of Blot and Sprig.
