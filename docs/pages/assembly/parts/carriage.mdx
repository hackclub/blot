- Put M5 hex nuts in all of the nut holes in the carriage.

- Assemble idlers by stacking 2 flanged bearings together.
  - The flanged parts should be the top and bottom.
  - Screw them to the bottom of the carriage using a 20mm M5 screw and 1mm shim between the carriage and the idler.

- Attach the v-wheels to the carriage.
  - Use a 35mm M5 screw, a v-wheel, and 6mm spacer between the v-wheel and the carriage.
  - *ðŸ’¡ Pro tip: inside the v-wheel's casing there are two bearings with a shim between them. Occasionally the shim will come misaligned - if this occurs, don't fret! Simply take a small allen key, insert it into both the bearing and shim's holes, and move it in a circle to recenter the shim.*
  - Repeat for all 8 wheels.
  - If the screw appears to barely touch the nut, you can pull the nut deeper into the nut trap by threading a screw through the nut.
