- Assemble idler from 2 flanged bearings and use a 20mm M5 screw to secure idler.
  - Put a shim between the plastic and the idler, and insert a hex nut into the rectangular nut trap.
- Attach servo to pen holder rail part (with the side with the motor hub next to the wall) using 2 of the 10mm M2 screws and nuts. The nuts should be on the outside face of the part.
- Attach the pen holder rail to the idler part.
  - With the outward face of the idler piece pointing towards you, the servo should be on the right when the idler part is screwed onto the aluminum extrusion.
  - Use a 20mm M5 screw in each screw hole.
    - Be sure to insert an M5 hex nut into the respective nut traps.
    - If you are running into issues, be sure the orientation of the nut is correct.
- Attach the idler part to the aluminum extrusion using 10mm M5 screws and t-nuts.
