- Insert nuts into nut traps.
- Attach the v-wheels to the pen holder using 25mm M5 screws and spacers (as previously described).
- The screw hole on the front is for securing the pen in the pen holder.
  - Be sure to insert a nut into the nut trap on the inside of the pen holder.
- Slide the pen holder onto the plastic rail (with the side with two v-wheels on the side opposite to the servo). The pen holder should freely slide up and down, and if you lift it up it should fall back down. If this is not the case, loosen the screws holding the wheels on slightly.
