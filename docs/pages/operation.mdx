# Getting started with the editor

After assembling the machine and getting your control board set up with the firmware, you can now use the editor (https://editor.haxidraw.hackclub.com/) to create drawings with your machine.

> ⚠️ Note:
> You'll need to use a browser that supports the Web Serial API. The editor is known to be compatible with the latest version of Chrome (version 89 or above). Other browsers that may be compatible are listed [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API#browser_compatibility).
