- Assemble idlers by stacking 2 flanged bearings together.
  - The flanged parts should be the top and bottom.
  - Screw them to the bottom of the carriage using a 20mm M5 screw and 1mm shim between the carriage and the idler.

- Attach the v-wheels to the carriage.
  - Use a 35mm M5 screw a v-wheel and 6mm spacer between the v-wheel and the carriage.
  - Repeat for all 8 wheels.
  - If the screw appears to barely touch the nut, you can pull the nut deeper into the nut trap by threading a screw through the nut.
