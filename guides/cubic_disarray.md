Let's try to recreate this in the Blot editor. A good first step to reverse engineering any artwork is to break it down into the obvious components. There's a grid of squares, and the squares closer to the bottom seem to be rotated more and more.

We can get started by setting up a turtle, and define some constants:

```js
const t = createTurtle()

const size = 10
const squareSize = 1

// ... other code goes here ...

drawTurtles([ t ])
```

Obviously we'll need a way to draw these rotated squares, so let's define a function for that:

```js
function draw(x, y, width, height, theta) {
  t.up()
  let startX = x - height / 2
  let startY = y - height / 2

  t.goTo(rotatePoints(x, y, startX, startY, theta))
  t.down()
  t.goTo(rotatePoints(x, y, startX + width, startY, theta))
  t.goTo(rotatePoints(x, y, startX + width, startY + height, theta))
  t.goTo(rotatePoints(x, y, startX, startY + height, theta))
  t.goTo(rotatePoints(x, y, startX, startY, theta))
  t.up()
}
```

This function takes in a `x`, `y` position, along with a `width` and `height` for the square. Lastly, we'll want a `theta` to rotate the points by. The function works by creating a square path, and rotating it around the center by a given amount. We still need to define how to do this rotation, though.

This can be done using the sine and cosine functions. They decompose a given angle into an x and y component, which we can use to preform the rotation. The function takes in:

- An origin x and y to rotate around
- The x and y to rotate
- The angle to rotate by

It then returns the rotated points as an array.

```js
function rotatePoints(ox, oy, x, y, theta) {
  let dx = x - ox
  let dy = y - oy
  let newX = dx * Math.cos(theta) - dy * Math.sin(theta)
  let newY = dx * Math.sin(theta) + dy * Math.cos(theta)
  return [newX + ox, newY + oy]
}
```

Great, we're almost done! Now it's down to simply drawing the grid. Loop over every x and y in some range, and draw a square there. We rotate them by a random amount, scaled proportional to how low the square is on the screen.

```js
for (let x = 0; x < size; x++) {
  for (let y = 0; y < size; y++) {
    draw(x, y, squareSize, squareSize, (Math.random() - 0.5) * ((10 - y) / 10))
  }
}
```

And, you're done! The final result should look something like this in the editor:
