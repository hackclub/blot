_I've tried to print the parts for this machine with various printers/filaments/beds/settings, and have listed my takeaways below. This was just my experience, so perhaps yours could be different._

- I recommend printing with PLA. Print at 90% speed for the first layer, with flow set to 105%. Then switch back to default (100 speed, 95 flow) after first layer.
  - 20% infill has been recommended for mechanical parts, but the 15% is probably fine.
  - If you print with PETG, you may have better results printing at lower speeds.
- .2mm is a good layer height to have sufficient screw hole/nut trap tolerances.
- Add circular feet (2x layer height) to corners for better adhesion.

- Don't use the textured beds!!!!!!!!
- If you're in a time crunch, best to print in 2 different batches. I've found 1 full sheet of parts to not always be successful.
- Clean bed with isopropyl alcohol
