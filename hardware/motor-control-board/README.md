# [Motor Control Board](https://leomcelroy.com/svg-pcb/?file=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackclub/haxidraw/main/motor-control-board/circuit/motor-control-board.js)

Ultimately the idea is that each device will have it's own little board which we network together through Modular Things.

For development purposes (and for the sake of doing due diligence) I decided to make a single control board as well which the two steppers and single servo and plug into. It saves money because the board only requires one Xiao instead of three. I decided to use SVG PCB to design the board because I'm pretty comfortable with the software (because I wrote it). Additionally, a community contributor to the project (Kris) recently added Gerber export which I was eager to use.
