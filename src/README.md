# Haxidraw Turborepo

This is a Turborepo that holds the libraries/code for Haxidraw. Using a Turborepo means it's super easy to turn things into individual packages but still have others that depend on them.

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `editor`: an Astro/Preact app
- `haxidraw-client`: a TypeScript library allowing you to interface with the Haxidraw device - also includes the Turtle library
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Setup

This Turborepo uses Yarn 3.x - if you have [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) enabled, you shouldn't have to worry about what version you have installed (Corepack will read the requested version from the `packageManager` property of `package.json` and configure it automatically). Otherwise, make sure you have the correct Yarn version by running `yarn --version`. 

We aren't using Yarn's zero-install system so the repo isn't hundreds of megabytes, which means you'll have to manually run commands to install dependencies and set up IDE integration:

```sh
yarn install
yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode
```

If VS Code doesn't prompt you, manually make it use the workspace version of TypeScript by pressing `ctrl+shift+p`, choosing "Select TypeScript Version", then "Use Workspace Version".

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
yarn build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
pnpm dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
