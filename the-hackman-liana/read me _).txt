// heyy this is my blot art
// it is a line art of The Hackman
// He is a ghostly entity that shows up at the middle of the night to remind hackers to complete their arcade sessions
// He has a little pet named Skull, who is a floating skull
// Skull is very done with the antics of Hackman, but he stays around to keep him out of trouble
// Mention Skull to Hackman and he assigns you an extra arcade session
// He stays until you complete the session
// thank you! see ya!
